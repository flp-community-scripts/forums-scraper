Description: 
1) Slide selected notes (no GUI): This script allows you to activate
slide/portamento for selected notes without deactivating it.
2) Slide toggle selected notes (no GUI): This script works as a toggle,
activating slide/portamento for "normal" notes and deactivating it if the notes
are already in slide/portamento mode.
3) Porta selected notes (no GUI): This script activates portamento for selected
notes without deactivating it.
4) Porta toggle selected notes (no GUI): Similar to the second script, this
script toggles portamento for "normal" notes and deactivates it if the notes are
already in portamento mode.
5) Deactivate Slide/Porta of selected notes (no GUI): This script deactivates
slide/portamento for selected notes.
6) Slide/Porta tool (with GUI): This script provides a graphical user interface
(GUI) for controlling slide/portamento, including options for inverting the
effect. Additionally, slide and porta toggle scripts have been added in the
latest update.
