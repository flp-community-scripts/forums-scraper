Description: 
This Python program allows you to control the overall length of all MIDI notes
to be proportionally longer or shorter. The main logic of the program is as
follows:
1. Get the end time of the last note, which serves as the original length.
2. Calculate the total length after scaling.
3. For each note, calculate its proportion of the original length and its
starting position.
4. Calculate the scaled length and starting position based on the ratio.
